## Intent
To avoid expensive re-acquisition of com.iluwatar.serviceadapter.soapdemo.resources by not releasing
the com.iluwatar.serviceadapter.soapdemo.resources immediately after their use. The com.iluwatar.serviceadapter.soapdemo.resources retain their identity, are kept in some
fast-access storage, and are re-used to avoid having to acquire them again.

## Applicability
Use the Caching pattern(s) when

* Repetitious acquisition, initialization, and release of the same resource causes unnecessary performance overhead.
